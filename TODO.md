# TODO

- Support more smart defaults to enable rendering a `line_graph` with the least amount of options possible (like not specifying any `x_value` options at all).
- Consider supporting custom controls like `table_and_line_graph` that would render data into a table and also visualize it in a `line_graph` above, below, or to the side of the `table`
- Consider the idea of supporting ChartKick's API syntax to provide familiar simple usage to Rails developers
